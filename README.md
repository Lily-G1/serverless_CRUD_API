# serverless_CRUD_API  

This repository contains python code required to run a lambda function. This function is part of a serverless architecture that builds a CRUD API on Amazon Web Services(AWS). Other resources employed include DynamoDB for our database, Cloudwatch for performance metrics and logs, and API Gateway to build the API.

As CRUD implies, this application allows us to carry out basic but crucial functionalities of adding items to our database,  
modifying these items, retrieving and deleting them.  

For a detailed guide on how to achieve this on AWS, i have created this [blogpost](https://liliangaladima.hashnode.dev/build-a-serverless-crud-api-with-aws) where i provide a step-by-step build process.

## Prerequisites  
- An AWS account (this project can be achieved on free-tier & costs $0.00)  
- A Github account
- A Postman account for testing API functionality
